## How to start the project

Execute npm install on the terminal, this will install live-server.
You can also install live-server with 'npm install -g live-server'.

Then go to the project folder and write "live-server" on the terminal. This should start the project on the browser.

Do not open the html file directly on the browser as it won't work (CORS problems). Install 'live-server' from the terminal as illustrated above or you can install the extension on VS Code.
